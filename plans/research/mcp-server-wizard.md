# An easier way to add MCP servers: a wizard proposal (2026-11-12)

Status: DRAFT, research and design only. Planned for a future release, **not in 2.15.0**; the rows are MCPW1 to MCPW18 in `plans/ROADMAP.md`, Track MCPW. Nothing here is built, no model was called and no product code was changed. Code read at `origin/main` 028a74050. Web pages were fetched on 2026-11-12 and are cited with that date; anything I could not confirm from the vendor's own page is marked **unverified**.

Owner's request: "lets work on a wizard or ui dialog for configuring and adding new MCP servers, research what features might make this easier for users."

## 1. Summary

1. **Adding a server today means writing YAML by hand.** Settings > Tools > MCP Servers has a `+` button that creates an empty file in `.continuous/mcpServers/` (`config/addLocalWorkspaceBlock`) and opens it. There is no form, no paste import, no connection test before saving, no place to enter a secret, no template and no registry. The one assisted path is the Cline and Roo importer, which only appears when it finds those tools' files.
2. **The pieces a wizard needs mostly exist.** Secret storage (`config/getProviderSetup`, `${{ secrets.NAME }}`), the import preview and secret rules (`importClineMcp.ts`), OAuth sign-in, tool pinning, launch pins, workspace trust, ENOENT hints in `MCPConnection`, the injection detector, the announcer and the provider-setup dialog pattern. The wizard is mostly composition plus three new cores: a paste parser, a launch-safety analysis and a non-invasive probe ("Test connection").
3. **Every comparable client has converged on the same four ideas**: a guided add flow with a package or URL as the starting point (VS Code, Zed, Goose), a one-click install link or marketplace (VS Code, Cursor, Goose, Cline, Claude Desktop bundles), secret inputs kept out of the file (VS Code inputs with `password`, MCPB `sensitive`, Goose secret keys, Claude Code masked `--client-secret`), and a status list with logs (Claude Code `claude mcp list`, VS Code List Servers, Cursor MCP Logs, Zed's status dot).
4. **The safety problem is the design problem.** A stdio server is a command that runs as the user; a remote server is a prompt-injection surface. A wizard that makes adding easy makes the dangerous step easy. So the wizard shows the exact command or URL, never starts anything on paste, asks for one explicit trust decision before the first connection (the probe is a connection), and treats tool descriptions from the new server as untrusted text.
5. **Privacy fits an existing pattern.** The official MCP Registry is a third-party host. Contact it only after a one-time ask, keep a dated local copy, search that copy, add one egress-allowlist entry of class O, and send no telemetry. A bundled offline template list needs no request at all and is the MVP.
6. **Recommended MVP (MCPW1 to MCPW6):** paste-to-form parser, launch-safety checks, a probe that lists tools and shows stderr with fix hints, a dialog (paste, review, trust, test, save) that writes the user's own `config.yaml`, secrets stored as secrets, and eight bundled templates. No registry, no deeplink, no import adapters in the MVP.

### 2.1 Configuration schema

`packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/mcp/index.ts` defines two shapes, validated by zod:

| Shape           | Fields                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common          | `name`, `serverName?`, `faviconUrl?`, `connectionTimeout?` (ms)                                                                                                      |
| stdio           | `command`, `type?: "stdio"`, `args?`, `env?` (string map), `cwd?`                                                                                                    |
| `sse` or `http` | `url`, `type?: "sse" or "streamable-http"`, `apiKey?`, `requestOptions?` (headers, proxy, CA), `oauth?` (`callbackPort`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `redirectHost`) |

Secrets are written `${{ secrets.NAME }}`. `docs/customize/deep-dives/mcp.mdx` documents the YAML. JSON files in `.continuous/mcpServers/` (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline layout) are loaded by `core/context/mcp/json/loadJsonMcpConfigs.ts` and converted by `packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/mcp/convertJson.ts`. There is no `enabled` field in the schema; the GUI's enable switch goes through `mcp/setServerEnabled` (where that state is kept was not checked).

There is **no `continuous mcp` subcommand**: `mcp` appears in `commands.ts` only as a slash command. `PL17` plans `cn mcp login`                    |

### 2.3 GUI

- `gui/src/pages/config/sections/ToolsSection.tsx`, "MCP Servers": a header with an add button (tooltip "Add MCP server"), the `ImportClineMcpButton`, and one `MCPServerPreview` per server with a status colour and tooltip, enable switch, reload, sign in or out, and a per-tool policy list. When MCP is disabled by organization policy it shows "MCP servers are disabled in your organization". In Chat mode an alert says all MCPs are off.
- The add button creates a blank workspace block (`config/addLocalWorkspaceBlock`, `blockType: "mcpServers"`). A file under the workspace is subject to folder trust; a server in the user's own `config.yaml` is not.
- `ImportClineMcp.tsx` is the only dialog for MCP: source picker, per-server checkboxes, a "store secrets" option, a result view.
- The setup patterns to copy: `gui/src/components/ProviderSetup/ProviderSetupFlow.tsx` (866 lines, steps, `ReviewStep`, `useProviderSetupDialog` opens it in the app dialog from every entry point), `OnboardingCard`, and the Test connection of the add-model form (`openaiCompat/testConnection`, result lines, host name only recorded, never a key). `LocalModelChooser` was not found on main.
- The announcer is `gui/src/components/a11y/announcer.ts`: `announce(text, "polite" | "assertive")`, text must already be safe to read aloud.

### 2.4 Permissions, injection and egress

- Policy areas (`plans/policy-areas.md`): five areas, five levels (Manual, Cautious, Automatic, Permissive, YOLO). Read-only MCP calls fall under Context use; every other MCP call under Tool use. MCP tool names are `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (`core/tools/mcpToolName.ts`) and a rule can name them. Rows B2, B74 and TR3 are about per-server and per-tool controls; TR3 (`mcpServers.<name>.tools.{allow,deny}`) is not built.
- Pins: first approval pins all of a server's tools (`pinNotices`), which means today a user approves the first call before they have seen the tool list as a set. TR4 (hide new and changed tools until approved) is not built. TR14 (description caps and normalisation) is not built.
- Injection: `core/tools/permissions/injection.ts` (`detectInstructionLikeText`), `suspiciousToolDefinitions` in `toolPinning.ts` (a hint, not a gate), and the tainted-session work in `permissions/taint/`. TR15 (wrap MCP results in a data tag) is not built.
- Command checks that a wizard can reuse: `fetchAndRunHit` in `core/tools/permissions/fetchAndRun.ts` (the `curl | sh` shape), `commandLint.ts`, `missingBinary.ts`, and the secret heuristics in `core/util/secretScan/`. I did not read their signatures; MCPW2 starts by checking they can run on a command string that is not about to be executed.
- Egress: `core/egress/egress-allowlist.json` classes are R, O, D, X and S, `denied` is `.run.app` and `.continuedev.com`, and `egressAllowlist.vitest.ts` fails when source names a host not listed with a reason. `PRIVACY.md` says the code names no Continue-operated host and lists "MCP servers you add, and their sign-in pages" under "Contacts a third party only if you set it up". The provider setup contacts `openrouter.ai` and `ollama.com` when it opens; the ask-once fix is PL27 (draft PR #661). The ask-once, dated-local-copy pattern is therefore a row and a draft, not a shipped feature; this note proposes reusing it, not copying code from it.

Package ownership checks (`mcpName`) were not on the pages read: **unverified**                                                                                                                                               |
| Consequence            | `isSecret`, `isRequired`, `choices` and `variables` map directly onto wizard fields; `runtimeHint` maps onto runtime detection. A "verified namespace" badge must say "publisher proved they own this name", never "safe"                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### 3.2 The protocol side

Spec pages read on 2026-11-12: <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/authorization> and `.../basic/transports` (the latest revision is 2026-07-28).

- **Transports:** stdio and Streamable HTTP are the two standard bindings. The 2026-07-28 page describes no HTTP+SSE binding; it only says clients and servers that talk to earlier revisions detect the counterpart's era and fall back. Our `sse` type is therefore a compatibility setting, and the wizard should detect it rather than ask for it. How to detect (try Streamable HTTP, fall back on a 4xx to the old SSE handshake) is described in earlier revisions; I did not re-read them for this note.
- **Authorization:** optional; for HTTP transports clients SHOULD follow the spec, stdio SHOULD NOT and takes credentials from the environment. Servers MUST implement Protected Resource Metadata and clients MUST use it to find the authorization server; the 401 carries `WWW-Authenticate` with `resource_metadata` and optionally `scope`. Client registration is by Client ID Metadata Documents, pre-registration, or Dynamic Client Registration, which that revision deprecates. PKCE, the `resource` parameter and the RFC 9207 `iss` check apply.
- **RFCs cited by that page, status checked in `rfclib` on 2026-11-12:** RFC 9728 OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata (proposed standard, current, 2025-04), RFC 8414 Authorization Server Metadata (current, 2018-06), RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration (current, 2015-07), RFC 9207 Issuer Identification (current, 2022-03), RFC 6749 (current, updated by RFC 8252 and RFC 9700), RFC 8252 OAuth for Native Apps (BCP 212, current). I did not quote any of their text.
- **What a wizard can use:** a pasted `https://` URL can be probed without credentials: an unauthenticated request that returns 401 with `resource_metadata` means "this server wants a sign-in", and the wizard can show the **Sign in** step instead of asking for a key. `mcpAuthProbe.ts` already exists for this; MCPW3 checks whether it can be called without connecting.

## 5. Safety and trust design

### 5.1 Principles

1. **Paste never runs anything.** The parser is pure. It does not resolve, fetch, install or spawn. The first process start is a button the user presses after the trust step.
2. **The user sees what will run, exactly.** The review screen shows the command and arguments as one string through the existing display mask (`maskCommandForDisplay`, `displayMask.ts`), the working directory, the names (not values) of environment variables, and the URL for a remote server.
3. **One explicit trust decision, before the probe.** The probe is a connection, and a connection runs the command. The decision is the primary button's label: "Run this command and test" (stdio) or "Connect to this server and test" (remote). Not a checkbox, not pre-focused on "Trust always".
4. **Warnings are specific and local** (no network):

| Check                                                                                                      | Wording                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Level                                                           |

5. **Secrets.** Values entered in the form go straight to the secret writer in core (`storeSecret`, the same one the importer uses: IDE secure storage, else `~/.continuous/.env`); the webview keeps the typed value only in component state and clears it after Save. The YAML gets `${{ secrets.<SERVER>_<KEY> }}`. The review screen shows the reference name and "stored in the system keychain" or "stored in ~/.continuous/.env", never the value. Pasted secrets are detected by the importer's rule (key name or token prefix) and by `core/util/secretScan/` and moved the same way. The probe's stderr and any error text go through the existing secret mask before reaching the webview, the audit trail or the announcer. Nothing about the form's values is logged.
6. **Provenance on the review screen.** "Pasted by you", "From the Continuous template list (version 2026-11-12)" or "From the MCP Registry: `io.github.owner/name` 1.2.3, namespace proven through GitHub login, status active, published <date>". The registry line is information, not approval. A deprecated entry shows its `statusMessage`.
7. **Tool descriptions from a new server are untrusted text.** The probe result lists names with a one-line description rendered as plain text (no markdown, no links, no HTML), truncated at the cap TR14 proposes (1,024 characters for a description) with a notice, after NFC normalisation and removal of control, bidi and zero-width characters (a copy of the TR14 function is not needed: the row is a dependency; until it lands, the wizard applies a local equivalent and MCPW3 swaps it for the TR14 function when that lands). `detectInstructionLikeText` and `suspiciousToolDefinitions` run over every description; a hit shows "This tool description contains text that reads like instructions to the model" beside the tool and, on Save, the default for that tool is Ask. The hint is not a gate: an honest server can trip it and a hostile one can avoid it. The review screen says so in one line.
8. **Pin at Add, not at first call.** Today the first approved call pins every tool of the server (`pinNotices`) so the user approves a pin for a list they have not seen. After the probe the user has seen the list, so Save can record the pin and the launch pin (X1b) for exactly that definition; a later change then asks. This needs the pin store's write path to accept a pin from the wizard, and TR4 for "hide new tools until approved". Until TR4 exists, Save pins what the probe saw and later additions follow today's behaviour.
9. **The probe never calls a tool.** It performs the handshake, lists tools, resources and prompts (using the existing pagination helper) and disconnects. Resources are listed by name only, not read. Prompts are listed, not fetched. A hard 20 s timeout (the existing default) and a 1 MiB cap on stderr.
10. **The probe runs with the same environment as a real run**, not a richer one. `MCPConnection` passes a small set of common variables (`HOME`, `USER`, ...) plus the configured `env`; confirming that nothing else leaks into the child belongs to MCPW3's first test.
11. **No auto-enable for workspace entries.** "Share with this project" writes a file under `.continuous/mcpServers/`; that file follows the existing folder-trust path and the dialog says "Other people who open this folder will be asked to trust it before it starts."
12. **Remote servers.** Show the host, whether it is HTTPS, and whether the probe saw a 401 with metadata. After sign-in show the authorization server's host. Tokens are never shown and live where they live today. Text returned by remote tools is untrusted by the existing taint logic; the wizard adds nothing but says on the success screen: "Results from this server are treated as untrusted text."

### 5.3 Privacy: the registry and any catalogue

A registry request tells a third party that the user is looking for MCP servers and, with a server-side search, what they typed. The rule in `PRIVACY.md` is that the code names no host the user did not choose and that Continue-operated hosts are denied. Proposal, following the OpenRouter catalogue approach (row PL27 and the 2.14.0 note; the code for it is a draft, so this is a pattern to follow, not a module to import):

1. **Offline first.** The bundled template list needs no request. The MVP has no registry.
2. **Ask once.** The first time the user presses "Browse the MCP Registry", a dialog: "Download the list of MCP servers from registry.modelcontextprotocol.io? Continuous will send a request for the list and nothing else: no search words, no identity, no telemetry. The list is saved on this computer with today's date and used until you press Refresh." Buttons "Download list" (default) and "Not now". The answer is stored in the user's own settings; "Not now" is remembered until the user presses Browse again.
3. **Dated local copy.** Pages of `GET /v0.1/servers?version=latest` are written to `~/.continuous/` as one file with the fetch date, owner-only, capped (size per page and total are **not measured**; MCPW14 measures the live registry first). Search runs on the local copy, so the search words never leave the machine. The registry's own `search` parameter is never used.
4. **Refresh** is a button, never a timer. Incremental refresh uses `updated_since`.
5. **Allowlist:** one new group in `egress-allowlist.json`, class O, host `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`, reason "opt-in MCP Registry list, after a one-time ask". `PRIVACY.md` gains one line under "Contacts a third party only if you set it up".
6. **No package lookups.** Whether an npm or PyPI version exists, or who owns it, would be a second third party. The MVP's unpinned-package check is local. A later, separately asked "Check this package on npmjs.com" can be proposed on its own row.
7. **Headers and body:** a fixed User-Agent naming the product and version, no cookies, no API key, no user or workspace data.
8. **Deeplinks never fetch.** A link carries the server definition; nothing is looked up.

JetBrains shares the webview; the entry points inside the GUI work as they are. The deeplink and the clipboard need an IDE-side handler per host (VS Code URI handler, JetBrains protocol handler), which is why they are slice 3.

### 6.2 Steps

```
 1 Start         paste, template, registry (slice 3), import (slice 3), or "write YAML"
 2 Review        name, transport, command or URL, env and headers, scope; safety lines
 3 Trust+Test    one decision; probe runs; tools, resources, prompts listed; errors with hints
 4 Tools         per-tool Allow / Ask preselection (slice 2); description warnings
 5 Done          saved where, secrets stored where, next actions
```

Steps 1 to 3 and Save are the MVP; step 4 is a read-only list in the MVP (names and warnings; the choice appears when TR3 lands).

A **Simple / Advanced** switch sits at the top of step 2. Simple is the form. Advanced shows the YAML for this one server (read from the same model), editable, validated live against the zod schema, with the error under the field. Switching Simple to Advanced and back keeps unknown keys. A user who edits YAML and returns to Simple sees a notice "Some settings are only in the YAML view" if a key has no field.

+------------------------------------+
```

Step 3, Trust and test (before the decision):

```
+------------------------------------+
| Step 3 of 3: Test                  |
|------------------------------------|
| This will run on your computer:    |

|                                    |
| [Back]   [Run this command + test] |

```

Step 3, success:

```
+------------------------------------+
| Step 3 of 3: Test                  |
|------------------------------------|

```

Step 3, failure:

```
+------------------------------------+
| Could not connect                  |
|------------------------------------|
| `npx` was not found. Install       |
| Node.js (it includes npx), then    |

| [Open Node.js download page]       |
|                                    |

| [Back]  [Edit]        [Try again]  |
| [Save without testing]             |
+------------------------------------+
```

"Save without testing" saves and shows "Saved. This server has not been tested." on the done screen; it exists because a server that needs a VPN or a not-yet-installed runtime is a real case. It is a link-style button, not the default.

Done:

```
+------------------------------------+
| Added github                       |
|------------------------------------|
| Saved to your settings.            |

| keychain.                          |
| It is on in Agent and Plan mode.   |
| Tool calls ask you first.          |
|                                    |
| [Add another]    [Back to Tools]   |
+------------------------------------+
```

Wide layout: the same steps with the form on the left and the tool list or YAML on the right; no new content.

### 6.4 Keyboard, focus, motion, contrast

- Every step is a form in DOM order; Tab walks fields, Enter in a single-line field does not submit, Enter on the primary button does. Escape closes the dialog only from a step with no unsaved input; otherwise it asks "Discard this server?" with Cancel focused.
- Focus: on open, the paste field; on a step change, the step heading (tabindex -1); after an error, the error summary; after Save, the "Back to Tools" button. On close focus returns to the `+` button that opened it.
- The paste area is a labelled textarea, not a contenteditable. The tool list is a list of rows with a visible text label for each state (the colour is never the only signal); "asks" and "reads" are words.
- One announcer: steps and results call `announce()` with polite text ("Step 2 of 3, Review", "Connected. 26 tools found.") and assertive for failures. No new `aria-live` regions. Announcer text is built from names and counts only, never from a command, URL or tool description (`announce` needs safe text; use `maskCommandForDisplay` for anything command-shaped).
- Reduced motion: the probe progress is a text line "Connecting..." with elapsed seconds, no spinner animation under `prefers-reduced-motion`. High contrast: warnings carry the word "Warning:" and an icon, borders not colour alone. Targets at least 24 px.
- Secrets fields are `type="password"` with a Show toggle that is off by default and announces nothing of the value.

### 6.5 Exact wording for states

| State                              | Text                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty list                         | "No MCP servers yet. MCP servers give the agent tools such as reading a database or opening issues. [Add a server]"                         |
| Paste not understood               | "I could not find a server in that text. Paste a JSON config, a command such as `npx -y some-package`, or a URL that starts with https://." |
| Paste contains several servers     | "Found 3 servers. Pick the ones to add." with checkboxes, none ticked by default                                                            |
| Name exists                        | "A server called github already exists. [Use github-2] [Replace it] [Cancel]" ("Replace" shows a diff of the two definitions)               |
| Probe running                      | "Connecting... 4 s. This can take a while the first time."                                                                                  |
| Success                            | "Connected in 3.1 s. Found 26 tools, 0 resources, 0 prompts."                                                                               |
| Save without test                  | "Saved. This server has not been tested."                                                                                                   |
| Registry offline                   | "Could not reach the MCP Registry. You can still add a server from a template or by pasting. [Try again]"                                   |
| Disabled by organization           | the existing "MCP servers are disabled in your organization"                                                                                |
| Folder not trusted (project scope) | "This folder is not trusted, so a project server would not start. Save it for you, or trust the folder first."                              |

### 6.6 Data model

MVP changes to `config.yaml`: **none.** The wizard writes the existing `mcpServers` shape and `${{ secrets.NAME }}` references. Writing preserves comments and key order in the user's file (use the YAML document API, as the importer does; to be confirmed in MCPW5).

Proposed, later, all optional and all neutral in the B21 sense unless stated:

| Key                                                                      | Purpose                                                                  | Class                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`                                                            | one line shown in the list                                               | neutral                                                    |
| `origin` (`pasted`, `template:<id>@<date>`, `registry:<name>@<version>`) | provenance on the review and in the list; never trusted for any decision | neutral                                                    |
| `enabled`                                                                | persist the switch in the file                                           | tightening when false, loosening when true: B21 classes it |
| `tools.allow`, `tools.deny` (TR3)                                        | the preselection of step 4                                               | loosening for allow                                        |

`origin` is informational: an attacker-edited file can claim any origin, so no code path may read it to relax a check.

### 6.7 CLI parity

The core steps (parse, analyse, probe, write) live in core and are called by both surfaces; the terminal gets the same review text and the same single trust question ("Run `npx -y ...` as you? [y/N]", default No, and a non-interactive `--yes-run` that is refused unless `--yes-run` is spelled in full and the command is pinned). `continuous mcp test <name>` prints the same result and exits non-zero on failure (like `continuous test-connection`). `mcp login` is PL17. The `/mcp` menu keeps its restart and stop items and gains Add.

### 6.8 JetBrains parity

The GUI is the same webview, so the dialog and the paste flow work. Differences to check: clipboard-read permission in the JCEF webview, a protocol handler for deeplinks, secure storage (`secureStorageAvailable` is false in hosts without it and the writer falls back to `~/.continuous/.env`, which the done screen must say), and the Windows `cmd.exe` path. No JetBrains-specific UI is proposed.

| Parser false positives | things that look like servers and are not: a README sentence containing `npx`, a `package.json` script, a `docker run` of a web app with `-p`, an `http://` URL of a docs page, a JSON file with no `mcpServers`, a `curl ... \| sh` install line; each must yield "not understood" or a warning, never a server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 8. Recommended slices

| Slice | Rows             | Contents                                                                                                                       | Order and dependency                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MVP   | MCPW1 to MCPW6   | parser, safety analysis, probe, writer, dialog (paste, review, trust and test, save), templates                                | MCPW1, MCPW2, MCPW3 in parallel; MCPW4 needs MCPW1 and MCPW3; MCPW5 needs the dialog design; MCPW6 last |
| 2     | MCPW7 to MCPW12  | CLI parity, edit and remove and enable from the list, logs, runtime detection, OAuth step, per-tool preselection               | W17 should land first or alongside; TR3 for preselection                                                |
| 3     | MCPW13 to MCPW18 | import adapters behind the wizard, registry browse, deeplink, export, pin at add, screenshots and accessibility gates extended | G0 and G1; PL27 pattern; O23 for new-revision servers                                                   |

Why this order: the parser and the safety analysis are pure and testable without UI; the probe is the highest-value feature and the riskiest, so it ships with the trust step or not at all; templates give the first-run user something to click without any parsing; the registry is last because it is the only feature that adds a third-party request, and because its schema has no stability promise.

## 9. Not verified, not measured

- The `vscode:mcp/install` and `cursor://` link formats from the vendors' own pages; the VS Code format above is from third-party generators.
- Claude Code `add-from-claude-desktop` and Claude Desktop's own bundle review dialog; MCPB signing.
- Registry package-ownership checks (`mcpName`); registry size and page count (needed for the local-copy cap).
- Where the enable switch is persisted, and where `MCPConnection` sends stderr.
- Whether `fetchAndRunHit`, `commandLint` and the secret heuristics accept a string that is not about to run.
- How the old HTTP+SSE fallback is detected in the earlier spec revisions (not re-read).
- No user research was done: the friction list in 2.6 is from reading code and the owner's request, not from observing users.

## 10. Open questions for the owner

1. **Where should the wizard save by default?** Recommended, pending owner: the user's own `config.yaml` (no folder trust needed, and the wizard's trust step is the user's decision), with "This project" as an explicit choice that writes `.continuous/mcpServers/<name>.yaml`.
2. **Should a user-config stdio server need the wizard's trust step on hand-edited entries too?** Recommended, pending owner: no change to hand edits; the launch pin (X1b) already asks when a definition changes, and the wizard records its pin at Save.
3. **Should the probe be allowed to run before Save at all?** Recommended, pending owner: yes, behind the explicit "Run this command and test" button; Save without test is allowed but labelled.
4. **Block or warn on `curl | sh` style commands?** Recommended, pending owner: block Test and Save until an explicit acknowledgement, and never allow it from a deeplink or the registry.
5. **Which eight templates?** Recommended, pending owner: filesystem, git, fetch, memory, sequential-thinking, GitHub (remote, OAuth), Playwright, SQLite; every command pinned to a version we looked at, dated in the file, refreshed by a maintainer with a test that the pins parse. Postgres is left out of the first eight because its connection string is a credential and the reference server's status was not checked.
6. **Registry in slice 3 or earlier?** Recommended, pending owner: slice 3, after PL27's ask-once pattern lands, so the dialog and the allowlist wording are shared.
7. **Deeplinks at all?** Recommended, pending owner: yes in slice 3, review screen only, with the banner, because a web page that can add a command to a developer's editor is the main abuse path; if the owner prefers not to ship that surface, drop MCPW15 and keep paste.
8. **Pin at Add (item 8 of 5.1)?** Recommended, pending owner: yes, because it closes the "approve a pin for a list you never saw" gap, but only after TR4 so a later tool is hidden rather than only flagged.
9. **A per-server `enabled` key in the schema?** Recommended, pending owner: yes in slice 2, classed by B21, so enable state lives in the file and the CLI sees it.
10. **Malware or reputation checks (Goose does a known-malware check)?** Recommended, pending owner: not in this track; it needs a third-party feed, which is a PV decision.
11. **User research.** Recommended, pending owner: show the MVP wireframes to five people who have never added an MCP server before building MCPW4; I can write the script (`design:user-research`).
