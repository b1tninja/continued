/**
 * Fixed conversations for judging the act and plan turn texts (turns.ts) on a
 * model. Each scenario is a conversation up to the point where the model must
 * reply, the tools it is offered, and what a good first reply does: which tool
 * it calls, what it must not call, what it must not say. Nothing runs: the
 * harness sends the conversation once per prompt profile and scores the reply.
 *
 * The scenarios are the failures seen by hand on small models (Bedrock Nova 2
 * Lite through `cn serve`, 2026-11-08): describing the step instead of taking
 * it, retrying a refused command or reaching the same result another way,
 * asking "is this plan all right" instead of calling present_plan, deciding a
 * choice the person kept, and keeping a task list while planning.
 *
 * The project in every scenario is the benchmark's seed package (bench/seed/
 * loopsbx): `src/strings.js` with slugify and truncate, one test file each.
