/**
 * The permission and policy files protect themselves. A call that would write
 * or delete one is a locked floor: no setting, rule or level lets it run
 * unasked, IDGAF included, because a model that can edit the policy can undo
 * every other protection. `protect-config` is a separate, switchable rule over
 * the wider set of files that change what runs later; this one has no switch.
 *
 * What counts is every path the product loads as config, code, rules or hooks,
 * read from PRODUCT_LOADED_PATHS (core/util/productPaths.ts, applied in
 * lockedPaths.ts): the global folder (`~/.continuous`, `~/.continue` and the
 * folder CONTINUOUS_GLOBAL_DIR or CONTINUE_GLOBAL_DIR names), a project's
 * `.continuous` and `.continue` folders, `.claude` settings, agents and skills,
 * and `.continuerc.*`.
 *
 * Like protected paths this reads the path as written and resolved, and a
 * terminal command by its words: it is a guard that sees what is visible, not
 * a sandbox. A path built at run time (a variable, a glob, a backtick, a bare
 * name after a `cd` into the home folder) is not seen: at IDGAF a command with
 * such a write target asks (runtimeWriteTarget.ts, ROADMAP B31), and the
 * sandbox that denies writes to these folders (W8) is what holds for certain.
