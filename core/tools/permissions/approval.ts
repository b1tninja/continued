 * is the behaviour from before levels existed (rules and the tool's own setting).
 *
 * Per area, for tool calls:
 * - manual: asks every time. Allow rules and the tool's own setting are not
 *   consulted; deny and ask rules and every protection still apply.
 * - cautious: the rules and the tool's own setting decide.
 * - automatic: as cautious here. What the rules leave open goes to the reviewer
 *   model, which the caller asks (core's `tools/autoReview`).
 * - permissive: a call the rules left open runs. A deny rule, an ask rule, a
 *   protected path and the safety floor still win.
 * - yolo: every call runs, whatever a rule, a protected path or the safety
 *   floor says. Only a tool switched off stays off.
