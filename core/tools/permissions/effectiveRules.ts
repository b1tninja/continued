 * (readRuleSources.ts) and pass what they read.
 *
 * AREA OF A RULE. The area is decided by the rule's tool name, the same sets
 * `areaOfTool` uses for a call:
 *   - Context use: readFile, listDirectory, grepSearch, globSearch (and the
 *     CLI's Read, List, Search, Diff, Skills).
 *   - File edits: writeFile (and Edit, MultiEdit, Write).
 *   - Tool use: runTerminalCommand (Bash), fetchUrl, searchWeb, every MCP tool
 *     (`mcp__server__tool`) and any tool this version does not know.
 *   - No area: tools that only touch the session (the task list, Loop's tools).
 * A terminal command rule is shown under Tool use, but a command the parser
 * vouches as only reading is Context use for that one call, so its `areaNote`
 * says the area is decided per call. Plan and Questions have no rule lists:
 * they have a level and a few settings.
