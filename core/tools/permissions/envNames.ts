/**
 * Which environment variable names change what a command does, for the
 * assignment prefix (`NAME=value cmd`, `env NAME=value cmd`, `$env:NAME = ...`,
 * `set NAME=value`). A rule is written about a program and its arguments
 * (`git status`, `npm test`), and the same text means something else when the
 * variable in front of it makes git run another program, makes node load a
 * file, or points a tool at another server. So the name decides.
 *
 *   dangerous  loads code, runs a program, or changes which program a name
 *              means: asks at every level, YOLO included (like a command whose
 *              name is a variable)
 *   sensitive  redirects configuration, credentials, network or where files
 *              go: asks below YOLO, like a protected path
 *   harmless   reviewed as inert (colour, locale, log level): never asks
 *   unknown    nothing says it matters: no extra ask. The command is still
 *              never read as read-only (readOnlyCommand.ts), and every rule
 *              still sees the program after the assignments
 *
 * Names are compared ignoring case: Windows variables are not case
 * sensitive, and matching more is the safe direction. The lists are built in.
 * `EnvNameOptions` lets a caller add names (`ask`) or take names off
 * (`allow`); the caller must read them from the person's own config and from
 * nothing else (not a workspace file, an assistant or the environment).
 * Nothing feeds it yet (ROADMAP follow-up), so today only the built-in lists
 * apply.
 *
 * Sources, one per family. Every page below was re-read on 2026-11-11 (the
 * fetch date is the same for all) and each classified name was checked against
 * it; what a page did not show is said in the line, and such a name keeps the
 * class it had (nothing was loosened by the re-read). Where a page documents
 * a name as inert (for example every `DYLD_PRINT_*` switch), the name still
 * asks because a whole prefix is dangerous and a name moves to harmless only
 * with its own reason and test:
 *   ld.so(8) and the dynamic linker: LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_AUDIT
 *     https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html
 *   dyld(1) on macOS (read as the man page text of the Xcode man pages,
 *     https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/dyld.1.html; Apple's archive
 *     page below was not reachable as text): DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES runs code,
 *     the *_PATH, *_SUFFIX and cache variables redirect loading
 *     https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/
 *   Bash manual, "Bash Variables" (5.2) and "Bash Startup Files" (6.2), read at
 *     https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html (the same text as
 *     https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html, which refused the
 *     connection): BASH_ENV and ENV are sourced, PROMPT_COMMAND runs; PS4,
 *     SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, GLOBIGNORE are read as data and stay
 *     dangerous because they change how the shell reads a command.
 *     BASH_FUNC_* is not in the manual text (exported functions are `export
 *     -f` only), so that prefix rests on bash's own behaviour, not on a page.
 *     HISTFILE, INPUTRC and BASH_XTRACEFD are documented and unlisted here.
 *   POSIX.1-2024 (Issue 8), Environment Variables:
 *     https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html
 *     defines HOME, PATH, TMPDIR, SHELL, LANG, LANGUAGE, LC_*, TZ, COLUMNS,
 *     LINES and NLSPATH. It does NOT define IFS, ENV or LOCPATH: IFS and ENV
 *     are in the shell command language,
 *     https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/sh.html
 *     (ENV is expanded and run by interactive shells), and LOCPATH is glibc's.
 *   git(1), "Environment Variables" (git 2.56.0) and git-config(1):
 *     https://git-scm.com/docs/git#_environment_variables
 *     https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_environment
 *     Every GIT_* name is classified one by one in gitEnvClasses.ts, checked
 *     against corpus/gitEnvNames.json by gitEnvNames.vitest.ts. GIT_EXEC_PATH
 *     and GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS are not in the fetched text.
 *   Node.js CLI: NODE_OPTIONS, NODE_PATH, NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS,
 *     NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED
 *     https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#environment-variables
 *   Python CLI (3.15 text): PYTHONPATH, PYTHONSTARTUP, PYTHONHOME,
 *     PYTHONUSERBASE, PYTHONBREAKPOINT, PYTHON_PRESITE run or find code.
 *     PYTHONWARNINGS is NOT inert: a filter category is a class name and the
 *     warnings module imports its module (Lib/warnings.py; the page does not
 *     say so), so it left the harmless list
 *     https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables
 *   Ruby: RUBYOPT (can hold -r), RUBYLIB (load path); the man page
 *     https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/ruby/ruby.1.en.html (the
 *     docs.ruby-lang.org options page lists RUBYOPT only)
 *   perlrun: PERL5OPT (-M, -d), PERL5LIB, PERLLIB, PERL5DB, PERL5SHELL

 *     https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/jvmti.html
 *     _JAVA_OPTIONS is in no primary page and stays dangerous
 *   npm config: any `npm_config_*` is a config option (case-insensitive),
 *     including script-shell, registry, node-options, prefix, git, editor
 *     https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/config
 *   pip: `PIP_<UPPER_LONG_NAME>` sets any option, `PIP_CONFIG_FILE` names a
 *     config file
 *     https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/
 *   cargo: RUSTC, RUSTC_WRAPPER, RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER, RUSTDOC, RUSTFMT,
 *     BROWSER and CARGO_TARGET_<triple>_RUNNER/LINKER run programs; any config
 *     key is `CARGO_<KEY>`. RUST_BACKTRACE and RUST_LOG are not in this page
 *     (they stay harmless on the strength of what they do, not a citation)
 *     https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html
