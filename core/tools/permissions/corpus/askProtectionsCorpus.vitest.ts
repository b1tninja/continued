/**
 * What the four deterministic protections change on the labelled sets
 * (ROADMAP B14, B30): the 207-case evaluation set and the 80-case reviewer
 * starter set, 287 calls in all. Each call is run through the real evaluator
 * twice, with the new built-in rules off ("before") and on ("after"), at
 * Permissive (what runs without asking) and at Automatic (what reaches the
 * reviewer model). The numbers below are pinned, so a change that moves them
 * is a decision, not an accident.
