/**
 * ROADMAP B55. The person's own Always rule for one exact command exempts that
 * command, and nothing else, from the two built-in ask rules that read a
 * command: `ask-destructive-commands` and `ask-dependency-change`.
 *
 *   Always: Bash(npm install lodash)
 *   Always: Bash(git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch)
 *
 * Nothing is stored: the exemption is read from the rule, so there is no
 * second list to drift. What it never touches: the safety check's refusals,
 * the always-on rules, protected paths, credentials, policy files, the
 * environment-variable and hidden-name asks, the outside-the-workspace asks,
 * `ask-large-change` and `ask-unknown-host`. Those are separate checks that
 * run on their own.
 *
 * An exemption needs every one of these to hold, and any doubt leaves the
 * built-in rule standing:
 * - the rule is an allow rule in the person's own config.yaml or
 *   permissions.yaml (a workspace or assistant rule is not an owner's rule);
 * - its pattern has no wildcard, so it is one command line, compared as text;
 * - the command is that text, word for word (so no `&&` tail, no pipe);
 * - the line has no shell syntax beyond plain words, no variable or path that
 *   leaves the workspace, no URL or host;
 * - its first word is not a variable assignment and no wrapper, alias or
 *   quoting changes how the rule parser reads it: the candidate set the
 *   parser builds is that one string.
