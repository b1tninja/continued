/**
 * Scrub-on-write for files the product persists (ROADMAP X15). Pure: no fs.
 *
 * `scrubForDisk` replaces every secret the shared rule set recognises with the
 * same `[REDACTED:<kind>:xxxx]` placeholder the outbound redactor uses, so a
 * file never holds a value this machine's rules know. `scrubDeep` does the same
 * for every string inside a JSON-shaped value, which keeps a JSON line valid
 * (a span is never cut across a quote or an escape).
 *
 * Best effort, like every pattern masker: a credential in a shape nobody listed
 * passes through, and a secret split across two separate writes is not seen.
 * Do not use it on a file that must round-trip (a session needed for resume).
