/**
 * Every place the product loads configuration, code, rules or hooks from. This
 * is the one registry the loaders name their paths from and the locked floor
 * (core/tools/permissions/lockedPaths.ts) reads, so a file the product loads
 * is a file the agent cannot change: a model that can write a hook, a rule or
 * a setting changes what the next session runs.
 *
 * To add a loader: name its folder or file here, in PRODUCT_LOADED_PATHS (the
 * product reads it as the user's own) or in PRODUCT_STATE_PATHS (the product
 * only writes it for itself). productPaths.vitest.ts scans the source for
 * paths read from the global folder and fails on a name that is in neither.
 *
 * No fs or node imports: the permission code and the GUI both import this.
