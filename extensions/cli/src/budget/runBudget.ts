 * The run limits of a plain headless run (`cn -p`) or `cn serve`: dollars,
 * model requests and wall-clock time. Semantics are ours, defined here and in
 * docs/cli/run-limits.mdx:
 *
 * - turns: one turn is one model request. A request is refused once this many
 *   have been sent in the run. A run that finishes on its last allowed request
 *   is not stopped.
 * - budget: USD at list price, counted from the usage the provider reports for
 *   THIS run (spend restored by --resume or --continue does not count). Before
 *   each request the run estimates what it would cost and refuses to start it
 *   if spend plus the estimate would pass the cap; after each request the real
 *   usage is counted and the run stops once spend has reached the cap.
 * - duration: minutes since the run started, checked before and after each
 *   request. A request in flight is let finish.
